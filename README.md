# hello-world
My programming ideas.
My name is David Bennion. I am just beginning code. Currently I am dealing with disability and it's been going on for my whole entire life. I have struggled with morbid obesity since birth. I weigh right now about 463 pounds, when I first entered into the hospital I weighed 604 pounds. Losing weight is a challenge. I have to walk 3 thimes a day and I had to cut down my calories. I have lost 143 pounds.
